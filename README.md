## Responsividade

- 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲

When working on a project, I use this quick and effective method to build a foundational color system. 

It includes:

👉 Primary color – The main brand or UI color that sets the tone.
👉 Secondary color – A complementary hue that works well with the primary color.
👉 Neutral color – A balanced tone for backgrounds, or subtle elements.
👉 Black & white – Essential for contrast, accessibility, and flexibility.
👉 Main colors – A set of colors consisting of primary, secondary, neutral, black, and white.
